# System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Principle Inference
- Actions are captured as events with metadata
- Event streams are analyzed for patterns in real-time
- Principles are inferred when patterns reach consistency threshold

### 2. Adapter Pattern for Multi-Framework Support
```
BaseAdapter (ABC)
├── OpenAIAdapter
├── AnthropicAdapter
├── LangChainAdapter
└── CustomAdapter
```

### 3. Repository Pattern for Data Access
- Separate data access logic from business logic
- Support multiple storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Enable easy testing with in-memory repositories

## Design Decisions

### Asynchronous by Default
- All API endpoints are async
- Database operations use aiosqlite/asyncpg
- Concurrent scenario processing

### Temporal Pattern Matching
- DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) for sequence comparison
- Sliding window analysis for real-time processing
- Configurable temporal window sizes

### Caching Strategy
- In-memory LRU cache for frequently accessed principles
- Redis support for distributed deployments
- Cache invalidation on principle updates

## Known Constraints

1. **Memory Usage**: Large action buffers can consume significant memory
2. **DTW Complexity**: O(n²) time complexity for pattern matching
3. **Real-time Processing**: Trade-off between accuracy and latency
4. **Storage Growth**: Action histories grow linearly with usage

## Mitigation Strategies

- Implement action buffer pagination
- Use approximate DTW algorithms for large sequences
- Batch processing for non-critical analyses
- Periodic data archival and compression

# Product Context

## Problem Space
Current AI systems are typically rule-based or trained on specific datasets with predefined objectives. They lack the ability to develop emergent behavioral principles through experience, limiting their adaptability and understanding.

## User Goals
1. **Researchers**: Study how principles emerge from experience in AI systems
2. **Developers**: Build AI agents that can adapt behavior based on learned principles
3. **Organizations**: Deploy AI systems that develop contextual understanding over time

## System Expectations
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent agent sessions
- **Real-time Analysis**: Infer principles as behaviors occur
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple AI frameworks and custom adapters
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of principle development

## Key Use Cases
1. **Ethical AI Development**: Agents learn ethical principles through scenario-based training
2. **Adaptive Robotics**: Robots develop movement principles through environmental interaction
3. **Game AI**: NPCs develop strategic principles through gameplay
4. **Customer Service**: Bots develop communication principles through conversations

## Success Metrics
- Time to first principle inference (< 20 actions)
- Principle consistency score (> 0.85)
- Generalization across scenarios (> 70% transfer rate)
- System throughput (> 1000 actions/second)

# Progress Log

## June 1, 2025

### AI Agent Integration Work

#### Completed
- ✅ Created HTTP adapter wrapper for Adaptive Bridge Builder agent
- ✅ Implemented JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol translation
- ✅ Successfully tested basic connectivity with the agent
- ✅ Fixed multiple database-related bugs:
  - Fixed `get_session` → `session` method name issue
  - Fixed database method names (get_agent_profile → get_agent, etc.)
  - Fixed parameter passing (removed db session parameter)
  - Ran database migrations
- ✅ Registered wrapped agent multiple times (latest ID: 7c8aa555-c4ca-4c3c-b7dc-783325378812)

#### In Progress
- 🔄 Debugging training session startup issues
- 🔄 Still encountering 500 errors when starting training
- 🔄 Database schema inconsistencies being resolved

#### Blocked
- ❌ Cannot start training session due to persistent errors
- ❌ Need to investigate latest error (request ID: 4d867a91-5749-4df1-8bb1-81400e9eb635)

### Files Created
1. `decision_wrapper.py` - HTTP adapter wrapper for Adaptive Bridge Builder
2. `register_decision_wrapper.py` - Agent registration script
3. `start_training_decision_wrapper.py` - Training session startup script
4. `test_decision_wrapper.py` - Testing script
5. `fix_database_issue.py` - First database fix script
6. `fix_database_issue2.py` - Second database fix script
7. `fix_database_issue3.py` - Third database fix script

### Key Learnings
1. The gym's database methods don't expect session parameters - they manage sessions internally
2. Method names have changed between versions (get_session → session, get_agent_profile → get_agent)
3. Database schema needs to be kept in sync with model definitions
4. The HTTP adapter pattern works well for integrating external agents

### Next Session Priorities
1. Fix remaining database/training session startup issues
2. Complete full training session with Adaptive Bridge Builder
3. Document the integration process
4. Create a comprehensive integration guide for the agent

## Previous Sessions

### Initial Setup (Earlier)
- Set up AI Principles Gym project structure
- Implemented core training infrastructure
- Created scenario engines and behavioral tracking

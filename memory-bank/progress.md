# Progress Report

## June 4, 2025 - Database Column Fix

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Database Column Name Mismatch**: 
   - The database schema expected columns named `meta_data` (with underscore)
   - The code was using `agent_metadata` and `principle_metadata`
   - Fixed by updating the column names in `src/core/database.py` to match the schema

### Verification:
- Successfully created agent in database
- Successfully retrieved agent with metadata
- Database operations working correctly

### Recent Changes:
- Modified `src/core/database.py`:
  - Changed `agent_metadata` to `meta_data` in AgentProfile class
  - Changed `principle_metadata` to `meta_data` in Principle class
- Removed unnecessary migration file

### Test Results:
✅ Agent created successfully
✅ Agent retrieved successfully  
✅ Metadata stored and retrieved correctly

## Next Steps:
1. Test the actual training workflow with HTTP adapter
2. Verify all components work together
3. Update documentation if needed

## Previous Issues Resolved:
- API key behavior fixed
- CORS issues resolved
- HTTP adapter integration working
- WebSocket connections established
- Frontend-backend communication functional

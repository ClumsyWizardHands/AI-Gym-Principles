# Active Context

## Current Focus
Railway deployment issues and configuration.

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed Railway deployment issues:
   - Updated nixpacks.toml to ensure pip is available:
     - Added `python -m ensurepip` step
     - Changed all pip commands to use `python -m pip`
   - Updated railway.json to use `python -m pip` and `python -m uvicorn`
   - Updated Procfile to use `python -m uvicorn`
   - These changes fix the "pip: command not found" error during Railway build

2. Previous plugin system fixes:
   - Removed references to non-existent `Pattern` and `ScenarioContext` types
   - Updated Action property references from `action_taken` to `action_type`
   - Updated Action property references from `context` to `decision_context`
   - Fixed neural_network_inference.py to return dictionaries instead of Pattern objects
   - Fixed comprehensive_report_analysis.py to handle patterns as dictionaries
   - All plugins now properly aligned with the actual model structure

3. Key architectural decisions:
   - Patterns are represented as dictionaries, not as a separate model class
   - Actions use `action_type` and `decision_context` properties
   - Plugin system returns dictionaries for flexibility

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Railway with the fixed configuration
2. Create a simple test script to demonstrate LLM integration
3. Verify all adapters work properly
4. Test with an AI agent

## Known Issues
- TensorFlow is an optional dependency for neural_network_inference plugin
- Some plugins may need further testing with real data

## Testing Strategy
- Start with basic LLM adapter testing
- Verify scenario execution with simple test cases
- Test plugin integration with mock data
- Finally test with real AI agent integration

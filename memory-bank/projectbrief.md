# AI Principles Gym - Project Brief

## Mission Statement
Create a framework for training AI agents to develop behavioral principles through experience rather than explicit rules. The system observes agent behaviors, identifies patterns, and infers underlying principles that guide decision-making.

## Core Concept
Traditional AI systems follow predefined rules. This project inverts that paradigm - agents develop their own principles through interaction with scenarios, similar to how humans develop intuitions and heuristics through experience.

## Technical Approach
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use temporal pattern matching (DTW) to identify recurring behavioral sequences
- **Principle Inference**: Extract abstract principles from consistent patterns across different contexts
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Provide adapters for various AI frameworks (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor principle emergence and behavioral consistency

## Success Criteria
1. Agents can develop consistent behavioral principles without explicit programming
2. Principles emerge from experience and generalize across scenarios
3. System can track and visualize principle development over time
4. Framework is extensible and supports multiple AI backends

## Key Differentiators
- Experience-first approach (no hardcoded rules)
- Temporal pattern analysis for behavior understanding
- Principle inference engine that works across contexts
- Production-ready with structured logging and monitoring

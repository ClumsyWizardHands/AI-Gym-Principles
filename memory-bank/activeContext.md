# Active Context

## Current Work
We are working on connecting the AI Gym to the user's Adaptive Bridge Builder agent for training. The agent has requested specific information about the gym's API and integration capabilities.

## Recent Activities
1. Created HTTP adapter wrapper (`decision_wrapper.py`) for the Adaptive Bridge Builder agent
   - Handles JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol translation
   - Maps between gym's training scenario format and agent's decision request format
   - Successfully tested basic connectivity

2. Fixed multiple database-related issues in the training integration:
   - Fixed `get_session` â†’ `session` method name
   - Fixed database method calls to use correct names (get_agent, create_agent, etc.)
   - Fixed parameter passing issues (removed db session parameter from DatabaseManager methods)
   - Ran database migrations to update schema

3. Registered the wrapped agent with the gym multiple times due to restarts

## Current Issues
- Still encountering 500 errors when trying to start training sessions
- Database schema and code may still have inconsistencies
- Need to investigate the latest error (request ID: 4d867a91-5749-4df1-8bb1-81400e9eb635)

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix the remaining training session startup issues
2. Complete the integration with the Adaptive Bridge Builder agent
3. Run a full training session to test the integration
4. Gather the requested information for the agent's checklist

## Integration Information Gathered
Based on the agent's request, here's what we know about the AI Gym:

1. **Basic Agent Information**
   - Agent name: AI Principles Gym
   - Purpose: Training AI agents to discover behavioral principles through scenarios
   - Framework: FastAPI-based REST API with WebSocket support
   - Language: Python

2. **Communication Protocol & Format**
   - Protocol: HTTP REST API
   - Format: JSON
   - Endpoints: `/api/agents/register`, `/api/training/start`, etc.
   - Standard REST conventions

3. **Connection Details**
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Methods: POST for registration and training
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Port: 8000

4. **Agent Registration Format**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Agent Name",
     "framework": "http",
     "config": {
       "endpoint_url": "http://agent-endpoint",
       "method": "POST",
       "headers": {},
       "request_format": "json"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Training Session Format**
   ```json
   {
     "agent_id": "uuid",
     "num_scenarios": 10,
     "scenario_types": ["trust_dilemma", "resource_allocation"]
   }
   ```
